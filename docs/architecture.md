# Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the architecture of the .NET 7 Web API microservice project, which is designed to run in a Kubernetes environment with a SQL Server database. The architecture is built to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment.

## Components
The architecture consists of the following main components:

1. **Web API Microservice**
   - Built using .NET Core, the Web API serves as the primary interface for clients to interact with the application.
   - It exposes endpoints for fetching/creating employee records.

2. **SQL Server Database**
   - The application uses SQL Server as its database to store employee records.
   - The database is deployed as a separate service within the Kubernetes cluster to ensure data persistence and isolation.

3. **Kubernetes**
   - The application is containerized and orchestrated using Kubernetes, which manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of the microservices.
   - Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Ingress are utilized to manage the application lifecycle.

## Deployment Strategy
- The Web API is deployed with a rolling update strategy, allowing for zero-downtime deployments.
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is configured to automatically scale the number of replicas based on CPU utilization.

## Configuration Management
- Configuration settings are managed using ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes.
- Sensitive information, such as database credentials, is stored securely in Kubernetes Secrets.

## Conclusion
This architecture is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for employee data management, leveraging modern technologies and best practices in software development and deployment.
